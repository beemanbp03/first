# A comment, this is so you can read your notes you silly duck
# Anything after the # is ignored by the program, so it will not show up once you run it.
print("My code should look like this.") # this comment right here is going to be ignored

#you can also use a comment to disable a chunk of code, like so..
#print("this code will not show up in the program")
print("but this code will show up in the program")
